# Project-Code
Code for generating the numerous plots which can be seen in the pdf titled "Project", which was completed as part of the my masters programme.

Primarily done using the python package KWANT to familiarise myself with tight binding systems and the basics of IQHE (Integer Quantum Hall Effect) and some trivial Anderson localisation stuff.

The irony of this being that I had coded much of KWANTs implementation for the above before discovering/using the package a few weeks into the project time.

Ideally would've gotten to do a bunch more stuff...like implement a finite size scaling regime for different things (Longitudinal Conductance, Localisation Length, blah blah blah etc etc etc)...alas no time as we got robbed of a third of our project time to inter-department politics :(

There's a few more files I should upload...if I remember to at some point I'll also upload the project pdf.

I was primarily focused on learning the theory behind Anderson localisation and QHE (mainly IQHE) as this would have been used in preparation for a Phd on FQHE (as to whether or not this will still happen depends on the gods of the Irish Research Council), so that and the project time being cut short is my excuse for the write-up seeming rushed.
