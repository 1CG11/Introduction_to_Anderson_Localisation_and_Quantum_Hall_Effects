# Project-Code
Code for generating the numerous plots which can be seen in the pdf titled "Project", which was completed as part of the my masters programme.

Primarily done using the PYTHON package kwant to familiarise myself with tight binding systems and the basics of IQHE (Integer Quantum Hall Effect) and some trivial Anderson localisation stuff.

Ideally would've gotten to do a bunch more stuff...like implement a Finite size scaling regime for a bunch of different things (Longitudinal Conductance, Localisation Length, etc)...alas no time as we got robbed of a third of our project time to inter-department politics :(

There's a few more files I should upload...if I remember to at some point
